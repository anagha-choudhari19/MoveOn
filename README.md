# MoveOn
Fitness tracking based on IOS kinematics data
# Problem statement 
Automation brings the advacement of technology reduce the efforts and has wide usecases. In todays world fitness has been given a lot of importance and many fitness tracking devices like smart watch are present into the market which uses sensors and gives status of one's activity. IOS device has sensors installed in it accelerometer and gyroscope. Using this devices the motion and location of the device is tracked.

# What is MoveOn 
MoveOn is a machine learning algorithm that uses the data collected from IOS devices and gives the status of motion of user. 
# Data 
The data is available on Kaggle and it consist of accelerometer and gyroscope readings of an IOS device of a user. 
We did the primary reaserch on data to find out it's insights which are written in 'SensorsInfo.txt' in 'Documentation' folder in our words. here is the link of data which is present on Kaggle
